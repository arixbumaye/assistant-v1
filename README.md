# Assistant V1

Assistant V1 is a next-generation personalized assistant for Mac, aiming to become the Siri that Apple failed to build. It is designed to be a state-of-the-art, always-available agent (like Tony Stark's JARVIS) that can be improved over time, perform actions and services on behalf of the user, and is easy to set up.

## Features
- Background listening and activation
- Voice-first, multilingual input (German/English)
- Modular action system (web search, etc.)
- Customizable voice and personality
- Menu bar UI for settings
- Persistent settings and logging

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up your local LLM (Ollama or similar)
4. Run the assistant: `npm start` (or via provided scripts)
